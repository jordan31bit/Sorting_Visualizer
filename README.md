# Yet Another Sorting Visualizer Program
I wanted to write a sorting visual thing in C# and SFML for a while just for learning. Also, I never used SFML before.
Upon launching the pgm will go full-screen and display the sorts in "real-time".

## Sorts Supported:
Bubble sort
Selection sort

## Depends:
SFML bindings for C#

### In Progress:
Um, like an indicator of the current bar being moved.
Displaying some maths stoof.
Simple controls and menue to choose which sort you would like to run.
